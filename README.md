### Abstract
This paper presents the NLP (Natural Language Processing) approach to detecting spoilers
in the IMDB review. Generally, these reviews reveal some information associated with the
plot of a movie. An automated approach, filtering out such spoilers, would be ideal as
manual labeling is impossible due to a large amount of content. To identify those reviews,
we propose supervised machine learning models. So, we explored Bi-LSTM, XGBoost, Naive
Bayes, and pre-trained GloVe to improve the accuracy in text classification. In addition to
this, we used the Bag Of Words (BOW), cosine similarity, and Term-Frequency and Inverse
Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method to process the text vectors. The results shown from
our models are satisfactory. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the proposed
method substantially outperforms the baseline model.
